# RAWGNARLY.com
Is the official website of my currently inactive fashion brand, RAWGNARLY!, which I built and operated until the my freshman year of college. This particular website, which was re-built from scratch at least 3 times and is still at last 1/2 crummy, was my very first introduction to web-development, so don't judge the (incredibly) messy pre-ES6, framework-less repetitive design, and excessively-frontend implementation. When I chose to hang the gloves due to prioritize my aspiration to build a career in academia, I sold over a 100 pieces locally and nationally, curated 2-3 drops (+ one that never saw the light of day due to COVID ðŸ˜ª), and fully designed at least 40(ish) garments that have yet to see the light of day. 
If it was through garment design, seller negotiations, creative photography, online marketing, or web-dev, I had an unexplainably enormous amount of fun working on this project. I am more than determined to one day, return to the fashion world and continue making clothes I love to wear.
Feel free to surf around!
