# rawGnarly.comRep 
This is the official website of my currently inactive fashion brand, RAWGNARLY!, which I built and operated for the entire duration of my senior year of high school. This particular website, which was re-built from the 0 at least 3 times and is still at last 1/2 crummy, was my very first introduction to web-development. When I was forced to hang the gloves due to the immediate prioritization of my aspiration to build a career in academia, I sold over a 100 pieces locally and nationally and curated 2-3 drops (+ one that never saw the light of day due to COVID ðŸ˜ª). If it was through garment design, seller negotiations, photography challenges, online marketing, or the web-dev itself, I had an unexplainably enormous amount of fun working on this project. I am more than determined to one day, return to the fashion world, and continue making clothes I love to wear.
