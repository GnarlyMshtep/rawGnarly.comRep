# RAWGNARLY.com
This is the official website of my currently inactive fashion brand, [RAWGNARLY!](https://rawgnarly.com/). RAWGNARLY! is a fashion brand all about having not-too-serious fun with your friends.

I built and operated the brand mostly during my senior year of high school. This website, which was re-built from scratch at least 3 times and is still at last 1/2 crummy, was my very first introduction to web-development, so please don't read the code ðŸ˜‰. Before hanging the gloves to focus on my academic aspirations, I sold over a 100 pieces locally and nationally, manufactured both in the US an abroad, curated 3 drops (+1 halted mid-manufacturing due to COVID ðŸ˜ª), and designed many more garments that never saw the light of day.

If through garment design, seller negotiations, creative photography, online marketing, or web-dev, I had an unexplainably enormous amount of fun working on this project. I am more than determined to one day, return to the fashion world and continue making clothes I love to wear.

I couldn't do this without my supportive and not-too-serious friends, which made this brand not only possible, but also a lot of fun.

### In the Future? (perhaps not near)
Pictures of summer20 garments that never made it, (unsolicited) advice, and sneak peeks of designs I never had the chance to bring to life.
